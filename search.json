    "text": "As a PhD student in ancient DNA genomics, I became interested in designing intuitive, programmable interfaces for complex computational methods. As a computer scientist, I wanted to think that computers should make our lives easier, yet doing projects in genomics often involved writing dozens of error-prone, poorly reproducible scripts gluing together disparate pieces of software for data processing or analysis.\nHaving learned the R programming language and becoming familiar with the “tidyverse philosophy” made me think about ways to make my corner of science more reproducible, more fun, and easier to do. I adopted R as a useful framework for achieving this and began building tools of my own.\nAs a result of this work over the years, I published the following R packages:"

    "text": "admixr\nadmixr was the first software I’ve published. I originally built it because I needed to run a large number of statistical analyses using the ADMIXTOOLS software suite—a powerful set of programs, but quite cumbersome to use due to their reliance on pure unix terminal interfaces and the need for setting up various configuration files to direct how analyses should be conducted. admixr solves this problem by providing a natural R interface for communication with ADMIXTOOLS programs in the background, automatically, from within R, and without any user intervention, and for presenting results in standard R data-frame objects.\n\nproject website\nGitHub repository\npublication\ncitations"

However, it soon became something much more general—an efficient, simple-to-use R simulation framework for population genetic simulations in general (spatial and non-spatial, forward or coalescent).\n\nproject website\nGitHub repository\npublication\ncitations"

    "text": "demografr\nAfter I built slendr, I realized that I have (accidentally) arrived at an extremely useful tool not just for population genetic simulations but also for demographic inference. After all, with any method like an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), the most challenging aspect is having to write custom-tailored code for simulation demographic histories and computing summary statistics, for every single project. slendr solves both of these issues by providing a trivially easy interface for simulation and genomic data analysis—which is where demografr steps in and builds an inference framework around slendr. demografr currently supports ABC and parameter grid-based inference, with additional inference techniques in the pipeline.\n\nproject website\nGitHub repository\npublication: in progress!"

I have many ideas ranging from more traditional aDNA population genetics projects, projects focused more to functional biology using archaic and modern human genomes, research software method development, to more unconventional projects involving the emerging large language models (LLM) and their application to wider, non-biological questions."

Additionally, I have several ongoing projects investigating contemporary societal dynamics on a much broader scale, extending beyond genomics alone.\nOutside of research, I love climbing, hiking, yoga, books, and all kinds of games.
