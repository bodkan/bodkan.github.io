I’m an assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen, specializing in
evolutionary and population genomics.

During my PhD, I studied the evolutionary histories of Neanderthals,
Denisovans and anatomically modern humans using ancient DNA. As
a postdoc, I focused on building software for spatiotemporal genomic
simulations and inference.

My current research applies the genomic methods I have developed to explore
new questions about human population dynamics over millennia. Additionally,
I have several ongoing projects investigating contemporary societal dynamics
on a much broader scale, extending beyond genomics alone.

Outside of research, I love climbing, hiking, yoga, books, and all kinds of
games. I’m also an absolutely massive Star Trek fan.
